# My Journey to Becoming a Software Engineer

Within this repository, I will document my evolution as a software engineer. Maintaining a record of our progress is
invaluable.
When I first embarked on my programming journey, I envisioned a way to reflect on my past decisions.
This repository stands as a testament to that vision, a chronicle of my growth in the world of software engineering.

## Programming Changes My Life

### Day 2330: Multi-dimensional Arrays

Today I started to learn how multi-dimensional arrays works in C. A multi-dimensional array in C is a similar concept like in Java and Python, the main problem is in C you can see the array as a 1D array in memory. For example, a 2D array is just an array of 1D arrays.  Yeah this s tricky, but when you understand this concept, your life will be more easy working with multi-dimensional arrays in C. I had a lot of issues to understand how access to the elements by a column. Remember that in Python you see a multi-dimensional array as a Matrix and in C is the same concept but in memory is different. So a Matrix have N number of Rows and Columns, accessing rows is easy, but accessing columns is tricky. Tomorrow I will need to continue practicing to understand how to access to the elements by a column. 

### Day 2329: C Pointers and Array Decay

Today I learned the `Array Decay` concept in C. When you use an array name in most expressions, the array name decays (converts) to a pointer to its first element. This was interesting for me, because you can the following printf and this is valid: `printf("%p\n", arr);`. The last fragment of code shows you the memory address of the first element of the array. Also I continue learning more about Pointers and Arrays of C while reading the Chapter 12: Pointers and Arrays fro the C Programming a Modern Approach book.  

### Day 2328: Pointers are Just Reference to Memory Addresses

Today I completed the `Chapter 11: Pointers from the C programming a modern approach book`. I had an AHA moment when doing the chapter code exercises related with Pointers. A pointer on C is just the reference to bytes storage on the Memory. We can see the computer memory like a big bunch of Cells, each cell have an address like 0x90, so you want to allocate enough memory in the RAM memory to store a `int` object, so you require 4 cells 0x90, 0x91, 0x92, 0x93. When you declare a pointer to hold the memory address of the the cell that holds the first bits of the int variable that is 0x90, you store this address in the pointer variable.  Really when you understand how the computer RAM memory is represented and which is a pointer your C life be more easy. These types of learning are not possible with a language like Java or Python.

### Day 2327: Pointers

Today I started to read the Chapter 11: Pointers from the C programming a modern approach book to learn more about how work with pointers on C. In my work in our C code base we do an extensive usage of C pointers in our codebase, I am not very good with C pointers and I want to continue learning how to work with them. I did multiple exercises on the book and at this moment I am in the last part of the chapter in which I will need to do some code exercises.

### Day 2326: TCP

Today I did a refresh about how works the TCP protocol. The `Transmission Connection Protocol` is one of the most used in backed application, HTTP 1 and 2 is built on TCP, this protocol creates a reliable channel between a client and a server through a handshake process, when the connection is created, the client and the server an send messages through the connection. Clients can send N numbers of messages and the server can just send 1 reply, when I learned this in the past I feel that this is amazing, with a Classic HTTP communication, you expect that always the server sends back a response for each client message.

### Day 2325: Socket Management

Today I started the course section that talks about Socket Management. I did a little study about how the OSI model is composed and the need to have a standard way to communicate devices over the network. The OSI model is composed of 7 layers, and each layer have a specific purpose, for example software developers most of the times works on Layer 7 - Application and sometimes on Layer 5 - Transport. I learned that my C and C++ application when create a socket with the `socket` syscall works on the Layer 7.

### Day 2324: Storage Management

Today I completed the Storage Management Course section. In this section I explored the Persistent Storage, File Systems, File I/O, and a demo about how to create partitions of different types like `etx4`, `fat32` and `ntfs`. It is very interesting how the OS manages all these concepts and how a basic thing like the file system is very complicated to implement, there are a lot of layers of abstraction that hide all the complexity of the file system and the storage management.

### Day 2323: POSIX API

Today I have been studying the `read` and `write` functions in the POSIX API. When you work with C code, and you need to do a I/O operation like read bytes from a Socket, there are a lot of steps that needs to happen in different layers of the Operating System. First your application needs to change to Kernel Mode to execute the read operations to return to User Mode to allow the user to continue working with the logic. It is interesting how many layers of abstraction are in a basic read operation like reading a file from disk.

### Day 2322: Environment Variables in Processes

Today I learned that when a process start, for example you have a bash script to do X stuff your bash script is considered a process. Your bash script have their own memory and resources that are not shared between the other processes running on the Operating system. An interesting thing is how the Environment variables works within a bash script. When the bash script reads and OS environment variable, it creates a copy of this variable in their memory, and if another process modifies the OS environment variable, the value is not modified in your bash process. All this stuff is interesting for me and there are a lot of things pending to learn and practice about process management.

### Day 2321: OS ENV Variables

Today I was debugging an issue related with a JVM 17 that cannot initialize because requires the `libc++.a` library and this library is not configured in the `LIBPATH` environment variable within the OS. The main problem was when the OS starts, the  `LIBPATH` not contains the library path, a script is executed within the server and that scripts configures the library path in the `LIBPATH` variable. SO I had a classic happens before relationship here, when one event needs to happen after another event. To solve the issue, I needed to add logic to check if the library path is included in the `LIBPATH` variable, and if it is not included, sleep for 10 seconds, and do an attempt later.  

### Day 2319-20: File I/O Operation

During these days, I continue studying what really happens when an application or process does a file I/O operation, like open a file to write. There are multiple steps in a basic File I/O operation between the Application and the OS that manages the request, now I understood why File I/O operations are expensive to perform.

### Day 2318: Event Dispatcher

Today I created the `Event Dispatcher` for my Even Engine project. I have a Event Generator in the server application that every second create mock events and add the events to a shared queue. This queue is shared by the `Event Generator` and the `Event Dispatcher`. When a client is registered in the server and send the message about which events wants to listen, the client is saved in a List, each client have a callback function. The general idea is the Event Dispatcher thread runs, in a separate Thread, and when an event arrives to the shared queue, it wake up to process the events, and send the event to all the registered clients that wants to listen for that type of event. I learned that this a common pattern on event processor applications, and also was very fun implement this feature with C++ code.

### Day 2317: Continue with Event Engine Project

Today I continue with my `Event Engine` Project. Right now my Event Engine server support create a socket to accept client connections, when a client is connected, the client send a message to indicate that the client wants to listen for events of types X, and this is all. I have create a generator thread in the `Event Engine Server`, so my idea is to store the generated events in a queue and next in the thread that handle each client, `poll` the events from the queue and send it to the client. In the client side I just want to read the events from the server and finally show them in console for debugging purposes. Tomorrow I want to continue working into this feature in my Event Engine project.

### Day 2316: Completed File System Section

Today I completed the `File System` section for the OS Course. On this section I learned how File System works, what is a File System, how the file system interacts with the physical hardware like SSD/HDD, did a little code exercise to virtualize how a file system saves a physical file in N number of chunks, depending of the LBA size, and how those chunks are saved into a PBA on disk. Was an interesting section and I learned interesting new things that change how I see programming.

### Day 2315: The Importance of Block Size

Today I have studying about why is very important to choose a correct Block Size for the FS Blocks, LBA and PBA. When you choose a lower FS Block, when the OS wants to save a big file into disk you will suffer `External Fragmentation`. External Fragmentation happens when you want to save a 5MB photo in a File System that have a 1KB block size. If this is the case, the 5MB file needs to be split in 5120 blocks, and then looks for 5120 LBA to save all these blocks. You can imagine the result of saving a 1GB file with a FS block size of 1KB for example. An `Internal Fragmentation` happens when you choose a big FS Block size like 4096 bytes and you save a 100-byte txt file. You are wasting around 4396 bytes for that Block because remember a `File System Block` is the minimum operation to write data to the hardware that the Operating system can manage. Some concepts are not clear for me yet, so I will need to continue learning this tomorrow.

### Day 2314: Continue with File Systems

Today I continue studying about how File System works. I learned interesting concepts today like how woks the `FAT32` file system used on 32-bit machines. Basically FAT means File Allocation Table, you can see this `FAT32` as an array (can be a map r linked list) of 32 entries, and each of these array entries like 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, etc have the address of a `Cluster`, and a cluster is just a collection of contiguous `LBA (Logical Block Address)` imagine that a cluster have `64 LBAs` and each LBA have a size of 512-bytes, you total cluster size is `32KB`. So if you want to store a file with a size of 10KB, you can store that file in 1 Cluster, yeah you can store only 1 file in a cluster if the file size < cluster size, in case the file is larger than the cluster, your Cluster have a reference to the next cluster with the data, so your file is split into multiple chunks to be saved in N number of clusters. Really it is interesting how all this stuff is managed by the OS and the lot of layers of abstraction are available that hide all this complexity.

### Day 2312-13: File System

Today I begin to study about file systems. The file system is a logical method and data structured used by the Operating System to storage data in the hardware device (SSD, HDD, etc). When you want to store a file within your computer, the OS needs to know how to store that file in the SSD, so the File System enters in action, the file system communicates with the hardware through their controller, and do the necessary operations to save the file. An important concept to understand about the File System is the file system Block Size, this block size can have different values but for simplicity we use the most common 4096-bytes, you want to save a .txt file with a size of 100-bytes, the file system issue a command to save this file in a FS block, and the disk controller do the next steps. This is trade-off, because you only want to store 100-bytes of data but you will need to allocated and fill the total space for a FS block, A big trade-off.

### Day 2311: Event Engine C and C++ App

Today I have been working into create an Event Engine application in C and C++. My main idea for this project was have the Event Engine working as a server that generates fake Operating systems events like CPU usage, memory usages, Disk Usage, and Network Usage. A Event Engine Client application can connect to the event engine server and listen for specific events through a subscription message. The event engine server will send the events to the client application trough a UNIX Domain Socket. This project is have been excited because I am learning C and C++ while doing the project.

### Day 2310: Storage Management Completed Section

Today I have completed the `Storage Management` Course section. On this section I studied about why we need to store data to be persistent like database information, how works an HDD and an SSD disks, the difference between them. I studied the SSDs Architecture and NAND, it is interesting how an SSD is designed and how the OS represent and SSD with LBA (Logical Block Address), the OS just see our SSD as a giant array, where each element is a block to store bytes normally 4KiB. Studying about the SSD architecture was very interesting, there are a lot of trade-offs in their design, but also are required. Now I know that the windows defragmentation tool was the dead for an SSD.

### Day 2309: Continue Learning SSD

Today I continue studying the design of SSDs. I do a research about why you cannot updated bytes in a page rather than do a remove and write operation, for me looks like a waste of resources but I learned that there is a physical hardware limitation that complicates this process. Also I learned that for example if you want to remove a Page, you will need to remove the entire block that contains that page, this is crazy because maybe your block contains 256 pages and you just want to remove 1 page. It is what it is. I did a C CLI application to create a simple SSD simulator to understand better how the SSD works. This application have some structs that represents the SSD components like the `Block`, `Page`, `LBA` and one of the most important the `FTL` (Flash Translation Layer) that acts like the brain of the SSD.

### Day 2308: Writing and Reading from an SSD is a Waste of Resources

Today I have been studied how SSDs works. I learned something that shocks my mind. When the OS just needs to store for example 10 bytes in an SSD, the SSD needs to store those 10 bytes in a `Page` and then write the entire page to the NAND flash memory. The main problem here is a page is normally 4KiB, 8KiB ot 16KiB depending of the SSD model. This means that if you just need to store 10 bytes, you waste a lot of free space. This `Pages` could not be modified when they are written, when you need to update those 10 bytes, first you will need to save the data into a new page, mark the old page as *dirty* and wait for a Garbage Collection to remove an entire Block. Yes another concept is a the `Block`, a block is just a group of pages (128 or 256 pages) managed by the **FTL** component. The FTL is a component that maps LBA from the OS to Physical Page Addresses (PPA). At this moment I don't know why we just waste resources in this way, I know that everything have a trade-off in software engineering and this for me is an interesting trade-off.

### Day 2307: Storage Management

Today I begin the Storage Management course section. I am learning about the primary storage hardware components like HDDs, SSDs, and NVMe drives. I am very interested on this section because in my work we work with storage virtualization technologies like RAID 1, 2, 5, 6, 19, etc. I believe that if I learn more about how the storage works in the low level, I can apply all the learned knowledge to my work. We don't manage the low-level code that does the virtualization, but we offer this features to clients through multiple APIs and client that user can use to manage their storage.

### Day 2305-06: Process Management Course Section Completed

Today I completed the Process Management course section. I learned multiple things about how the Operating systems manage the processes in the system. In the final modules I did a little exercise to know how to debug a C application to understand how the memory is shared with a child process and the parent process. To know information about a process you can go the `/proc/PID` folder and there you can find multiple files that contains information about that specific process. For example the `status` file contains information like the UID, GID, memory usage, number of threads, etc. Also I learned about the different states of a process like Running, Waiting, Stopped, Zombie, etc.

### Day 2304: Concurrency

Today I have been studying concurrency. I learned that concurrency can be achieved in two main ways, multithreading and multiprocessing. Multithreading is when you have multiple threads running in the same process, and multiprocessing is when your application is composed of multiple process, for example you have a process that just wait for incoming user input and another process execute the user request. Also I studied about Mutexes and Semaphores to avoid common concurrency issues. I like Mutexes are very simple to understand and implement.

### Day 2303: Context Switching

Today I have been studying how the CPU performs a context switch. Your CPU is executing process A and the Kernel sends a signal to the CPU to stop to execute Process A, the CPU needs to start the context switch to execute Process B. The context switch process have the following steps: 1. Save the state of process A into the Process PCB (Process Control Block), 2. Load the state of process B into the Process PCB, 3. Switch the CPU to execute process B. As a additional consideration, when the CPU starts to execute process B the execution is slow at the start because the CPU needs to load the L1 cache with the instructions of process B. This is called cache miss.

### Day 2302: Process VS Thread Section Completed

Today I completed the Process VS Thread course section. I learned the main differences between a `process` and a `thread` like a process is the instance of a program running on the operating system and have dedicated multiple resources like memory sections, file descriptors, etc. In the other side a `Thread` is a light weight process that share most of the same memory of the parent process, but maintains some memory for the thread state. Always a thread needs to have a reference to the parent process for multiple purposes. Really it is interesting how when your learn about how Linux works, you see programming in another way and you can start to think the multiple times that you can apply Linux principles and design in code.

### Day 2301: Thread Control Block (TCB)

Today I have been studying the Thread Control Block. I see the thread control block as a data structured used by the Kernel to store metadata about a thread. When we have a process running we can create N number of thread for that process, this is when the TCB enters in action because to schedule the thread, execute the thread, the Kernel uses the TCB. I did a C application in which I create a thread and configuring some TCB attributes like the Stack Size and Priority. The TCB is stored in memory in Kernel space and in modern linux OS a thread have a dedicated TCB. This TCB also contains a reference to the parent PCB and a reference to the next TCB.
