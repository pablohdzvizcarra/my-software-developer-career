# My Journey to Becoming a Software Engineer

Within this repository, I will document my evolution as a software engineer. Maintaining a record of our progress is
invaluable.
When I first embarked on my programming journey, I envisioned a way to reflect on my past decisions.
This repository stands as a testament to that vision, a chronicle of my growth in the world of software engineering.

## Programming Changes My Life

### Day 2103: Read Repair and Replicate Synchronization

Today I studied the `Read Repair` and `Replicate Synchronization` models for replication in distributed systems. The Read repair is used when a manager request to read some data from a node, when the data arrives the manager send again that data to all nodes, the nodes next to review if the data state is equal for the copy they have, if the data is not equal the nodes can replace with the correct data version, this pattern is very interesting because work in a reactive way, nodes review their data state only when a Client ask for that data. In the other hand the Replicate Synchronization model works like a cron job, that sends the data state to all other nodes every N number of seconds, minutes and hours. Each of these models have their trade-offs and benefits.

### Day 2102: Free Code Day

Today I take a free code date. I want to take a free date because my brain needs some rest from code and software engineering topics. I watched some parts of the LexFridman podcast with DHH (creator of ruby on rails) one of the best programmers in the world for me and also a father of three like me.

### Day 2101: Memory Addresses and Pointers

Today while coding in C I learned something interesting. Working with strings in C can be a little tricky, for example if you have a string and you use that string to create a copy into another variable like: `char *new_data = old_data;`, that works but the `old_data` and `new_data` variables points to the same memory address, and if you clean up the `old_data` variable like `free(old_data);` you end having a `new_data` variable with a empty value, that was surprised for me because the compiler and the application continues working without issues with this behavior. I know that changing the value of a variable like in java `String data = null;` its possible but well I will need to learn the differences and how the C manage the objects in the stack and memory. For the moment I continue learning C and coding more stuff.
