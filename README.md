# My Journey to Becoming a Software Engineer

Within this repository, I will document my evolution as a software engineer. Maintaining a record of our progress is
invaluable.
When I first embarked on my programming journey, I envisioned a way to reflect on my past decisions.
This repository stands as a testament to that vision, a chronicle of my growth in the world of software engineering.

## Programming Changes My Life

### Day 2311: Event Engine C and C++ App

Today I have been working into create an Event Engine application in C and C++. My main idea for this project was have the Event Engine working as a server that generates fake Operating systems events like CPU usage, memory usages, Disk Usage, and Network Usage. A Event Engine Client application can connect to the event engine server and listen for specific events through a subscription message. The event engine server will send the events to the client application trough a UNIX Domain Socket. This project is have been excited because I am learning C and C++ while doing the project.

### Day 2310: Storage Management Completed Section

Today I have completed the `Storage Management` Course section. On this section I studied about why we need to store data to be persistent like database information, how works an HDD and an SSD disks, the difference between them. I studied the SSDs Architecture and NAND, it is interesting how an SSD is designed and how the OS represent and SSD with LBA (Logical Block Address), the OS just see our SSD as a giant array, where each element is a block to store bytes normally 4KiB. Studying about the SSD architecture was very interesting, there are a lot of trade-offs in their design, but also are required. Now I know that the windows defragmentation tool was the dead for an SSD.

### Day 2309: Continue Learning SSD

Today I continue studying the design of SSDs. I do a research about why you cannot updated bytes in a page rather than do a remove and write operation, for me looks like a waste of resources but I learned that there is a physical hardware limitation that complicates this process. Also I learned that for example if you want to remove a Page, you will need to remove the entire block that contains that page, this is crazy because maybe your block contains 256 pages and you just want to remove 1 page. It is what it is. I did a C CLI application to create a simple SSD simulator to understand better how the SSD works. This application have some structs that represents the SSD components like the `Block`, `Page`, `LBA` and one of the most important the `FTL` (Flash Translation Layer) that acts like the brain of the SSD.

### Day 2308: Writing and Reading from an SSD is a Waste of Resources

Today I have been studied how SSDs works. I learned something that shocks my mind. When the OS just needs to store for example 10 bytes in an SSD, the SSD needs to store those 10 bytes in a `Page` and then write the entire page to the NAND flash memory. The main problem here is a page is normally 4KiB, 8KiB ot 16KiB depending of the SSD model. This means that if you just need to store 10 bytes, you waste a lot of free space. This `Pages` could not be modified when they are written, when you need to update those 10 bytes, first you will need to save the data into a new page, mark the old page as *dirty* and wait for a Garbage Collection to remove an entire Block. Yes another concept is a the `Block`, a block is just a group of pages (128 or 256 pages) managed by the **FTL** component. The FTL is a component that maps LBA from the OS to Physical Page Addresses (PPA). At this moment I don't know why we just waste resources in this way, I know that everything have a trade-off in software engineering and this for me is an interesting trade-off.

### Day 2307: Storage Management

Today I begin the Storage Management course section. I am learning about the primary storage hardware components like HDDs, SSDs, and NVMe drives. I am very interested on this section because in my work we work with storage virtualization technologies like RAID 1, 2, 5, 6, 19, etc. I believe that if I learn more about how the storage works in the low level, I can apply all the learned knowledge to my work. We don't manage the low-level code that does the virtualization, but we offer this features to clients through multiple APIs and client that user can use to manage their storage.

### Day 2305-06: Process Management Course Section Completed

Today I completed the Process Management course section. I learned multiple things about how the Operating systems manage the processes in the system. In the final modules I did a little exercise to know how to debug a C application to understand how the memory is shared with a child process and the parent process. To know information about a process you can go the `/proc/PID` folder and there you can find multiple files that contains information about that specific process. For example the `status` file contains information like the UID, GID, memory usage, number of threads, etc. Also I learned about the different states of a process like Running, Waiting, Stopped, Zombie, etc.

### Day 2304: Concurrency

Today I have been studying concurrency. I learned that concurrency can be achieved in two main ways, multithreading and multiprocessing. Multithreading is when you have multiple threads running in the same process, and multiprocessing is when your application is composed of multiple process, for example you have a process that just wait for incoming user input and another process execute the user request. Also I studied about Mutexes and Semaphores to avoid common concurrency issues. I like Mutexes are very simple to understand and implement.

### Day 2303: Context Switching

Today I have been studying how the CPU performs a context switch. Your CPU is executing process A and the Kernel sends a signal to the CPU to stop to execute Process A, the CPU needs to start the context switch to execute Process B. The context switch process have the following steps: 1. Save the state of process A into the Process PCB (Process Control Block), 2. Load the state of process B into the Process PCB, 3. Switch the CPU to execute process B. As a additional consideration, when the CPU starts to execute process B the execution is slow at the start because the CPU needs to load the L1 cache with the instructions of process B. This is called cache miss.

### Day 2302: Process VS Thread Section Completed

Today I completed the Process VS Thread course section. I learned the main differences between a `process` and a `thread` like a process is the instance of a program running on the operating system and have dedicated multiple resources like memory sections, file descriptors, etc. In the other side a `Thread` is a light weight process that share most of the same memory of the parent process, but maintains some memory for the thread state. Always a thread needs to have a reference to the parent process for multiple purposes. Really it is interesting how when your learn about how Linux works, you see programming in another way and you can start to think the multiple times that you can apply Linux principles and design in code.

### Day 2301: Thread Control Block (TCB)

Today I have been studying the Thread Control Block. I see the thread control block as a data structured used by the Kernel to store metadata about a thread. When we have a process running we can create N number of thread for that process, this is when the TCB enters in action because to schedule the thread, execute the thread, the Kernel uses the TCB. I did a C application in which I create a thread and configuring some TCB attributes like the Stack Size and Priority. The TCB is stored in memory in Kernel space and in modern linux OS a thread have a dedicated TCB. This TCB also contains a reference to the parent PCB and a reference to the next TCB.
