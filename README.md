# My Journey to Becoming a Software Engineer

Within this repository, I will document my evolution as a software engineer. Maintaining a record of our progress is
invaluable.
When I first embarked on my programming journey, I envisioned a way to reflect on my past decisions.
This repository stands as a testament to that vision, a chronicle of my growth in the world of software engineering.

## Programming Changes My Life

### Day 2154: Fixing Protocol Logic

Today I was working into fix my code for support the WRITE message the problem was with the protocol design change to send first 4 bytes as a header that indicates the message length, I will need to change multiple files in my Block Storage application to change the Decode and Encode logic. The good news are thanks that I had unit tests this fix is easy to apply and validates that the logic is working. I estimate that it will take me three more days to fix the code to support the new protocol design.

### Day 2153: Protocol Symmetry

Today I changed how my binary protocol creates and send the responses to the clients to follow protocol symmetry also I learned what is this principle in binary protocols.
Protocol Symmetry is when your binary protocol have the same design for request and responses, for example for request client, first my protocol requires that clients sends a header integer (4 bytes) to know how many bytes the server needs to read next to read the full request. The same happens for responses, the server needs to send a header and clients needs to read the exact number of bytes as the header value. Modifying my protocol to have meet this principle it is being difficult because I am also fixing my current integration and unit tests.

### Day 2152: Monitoring

Today I read the Building distributed systems Monitoring chapter. The monitoring chapter describes the most common industry techniques to monitor the health of a software application, to have a healthy application you need to configure a mix of some features like Metrics, Service-level indicators, service-level objectives, alerts and dashboards. The chapter is focused on the importance of setup these features and the importance of automate the most possible actions to fix an unhealthy system.

### Day 2151: Completed 50 days

Today I created the table entry that contains the skills leader and practicing in the last 50 days. I feel good with my progress during these days I dedicated most of my time to build an application to learn new skills. This application is hard and the technical level is very good, is not a basic CRUD or a simple HTTP server.
